# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose behind this project is to make the bootcamp easier for students by allowing them to structurally organize their notes in a web application. This makes revision more efficient because information is compartmentalized for improved user access. Throughout this project, I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct a basic web application and how to complete the Git flow to sync your local repository with the Git repository  

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains information in bullet points about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Github for you to revise

For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
